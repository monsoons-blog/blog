# **Ghazals**

 **Overview**


Originating in 7th century Arabia, this form of shairi has historically focused on matters of love (spiritual or worldy), with a particular emphasis on separation and reunification with the beloved. While the technical constraints are strict, ghazals do not need to have a single topic running through the poem. Rather, they emphasize a tone or a mood more than any narrative continuity. Often abstract, ghazals employ contradictions, opposites and multiplicities of meaning.

Common themes portrayed in Urdu ghazals:

- Lover and beloved
- Seperation and reunion  (hijr aur wisaal)
- Wordly love and spiritual love  (ishq-e-mijazi, ishq-e-haqiqi)
- Self and society 
- Language and inneffability
- Symbol and referrant 


Classical imagery evoked in Urdu ghazals:

- Gardens, flowers and songbirds
- Moths and flames
- Lamps and candles
- Wine, goblets and taverns
- Dawn and dusk
- Light and dark
- Mirrors and reflections
- Rivers and oceans 


**Technicalities**


Ghazals are usually composed of five to fifteen shers. The poetic devices of the ghazal are illustrated in the following [ghazal](https://www.rekhta.org/ghazals/haalaat-ke-qadmon-pe-qalandar-nahiin-girtaa-qateel-shifai-ghazals?sort=popularity-desc) by Qateel Shifai:

**Radeef (ردیف)** is the repeating word in the second misrah of every sher of the ghazal.

**Qaafiya ( قافیہ)** is the rhyming suffix, word or pattern of words that precedes the radeef.   

**Matlah** is the first sher of the ghazal, where the radeef is present at the end of both misrahs, and **maqta** is the last sher of the ghazal, which _may_ include the **takhalus**, or pen name, of the poet.

**Bahr** is the meter of the shairi. See the appendix for an in depth description of bahr.

# **Nazms**

The nazm is an umbrella term that includes all free verse poems without any explicit rules or structures in form. Often they are written on a particular topic or set of topics, and may have more narrative continuity than ghazals. Though there arent any formal constraints, the following poetic devices are used in nazms:

**Prompt 1** 

Urdu has many different words for, and ways of describing, fire. Listen to [this description](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Tv4XP2gZK02r5jso3m6zK?si=7665e4c3621149d3) of four Urdu words that describe different intensities of fire. Can you write a sher (or the first line of a nazm) that incorporates one of these words?

_dahkā huā hai ātish-e-gul se chaman tamām_
