Surbahar plays heart out to nothing \
Stepping out past step or notion \
Life is best lived remotely â€“ that childhood \
Observing only (sentiment sealing (sophisticated security)) \
Listen it's quite blue after a hundred notes and silent after a thousand? \
It's the blankness of your eyes aajkal \
Akin to modern masters, their vacant canvas or patternless jazz \
Shows over, airtight silence hums under, dark sky over \
The way wind interrogates through unsemantic beauty. \
Questions ambrose \
posing at punctuations of our years and centuries for all to relish \
or suffer therein
