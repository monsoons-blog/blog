fade off-stage into postmodern pine \
stumbling on ancestral wonders of \
thirst and hunger

gaps between prehistory shrink distance \
time expands birthing: moss theatres, a dampened language

“I” was an actor, even my name \
soaks dry under the sun decomposing \
stars too being in the forest, \
breathing senseless sunsets 

the world is thrown into itself \
to forget how to be and become

Overgrowth in the cracks of our self-portraits (like all ruins) \
the frames turning graves beneath this earth: \
Stories reclaimed by undergrowth
