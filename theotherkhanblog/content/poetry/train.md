Excerpts from <em>the L train isnt running</em> :

the L train / isn't running / i guess / \
i'll tread / the long route / this time / \
sometimes / it can be nice / to forget / \
all the laws / counting pebbles / \
on a chain / smoking / cigarette / \
fumes / my lungs / refreshed / \
on the sunlit steps / of a giant / \
a glass house / of canvases / coated / \
in hues / of New York / of Hopper / \
sweet Whitney / dirty Whitney / \
crowds / leak / in / out / a tiny crevice / \
to know waiting / is to know living / \
to read a book / or sing / a song / \
a stare / far enough / at the seam / \
the river / slips / into the sky //

---------------------------


to enter / the void / to fill it in / \
is a pilgrimage / not a vacation / \
rushing / working / writing our path / \
navigating / an elaborate maze / \
aisles / stacks / of all / the things / \
purchasable / it was easy / to get lost / \
in this market / but as we search / \
we find each other / sitting / across / \
mimicking / a playful / reticence / \
like the sun / that had shied away / \
from her / earlier in the day / \
with coffee / cream / churros / \
split / between us / we spoke / \
of space / time / of our lives / \
there were blanks / still left to fill / \
voids / left / in our hearts / \
in her words / came a gentle push / \
a spirited nudge / whence the malaise / \
she said / at least you have a song / \
on your lips / a tune to whistle / \
she lit a flame / that dusky night / \
this duet / of rest / and rhythm / \
of searching / of stopping / sitting / \
together / was probably enough / \
in the absence of meaning //

the L train / isn't running / i guess / \
we can sit / sing / and wait /
until another day returns //
