on that electric pivot of time \
between beliefs, languages, sighs \
young bodies disassembled \
every bone studied, swapped \
oriented back with tight tilt \
strict and sunbound new

sixty repeated impalements \
scatter old sun to pieces \
moth bodies constellating \
cold star tissue new 

The sky is a sarcophagus - definite and dead - to be read.

and those crypts - memory, skin, language \
age into pyramids \
for viewing night
