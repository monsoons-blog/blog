Confusing myself for the bad deed   
I woke up at sunrise and said: not anymore \
Like escaping your own smell \
And I would molt skin and bone but my ancestor said: \
the scent lingers 

Incarcerated firefighters today announced a breakthrough  \
I was heartbroken in believing the progress

Retaliations confused us, we thought we had \
quenched it safely in the near east (the far west) \
until the jungles melted to a virus of trash bags \
masked in tropical fragrance

Perhaps it is not up to me so Iâ€™ll say \
I light this flame in dedication to my progenitors, \
part of the human inheritance

In the name of posterity: \
I drone strike our archeaology into a boneless soil \
this underbrush has been building up long between us \
down in the crowded underworld

you disbelieve when I say violence is chronic to every evolution \
you stand for sapient exceptionalisms reminiscent of America

In truth I pray you will condemn me, forgive me for napalm baptismals \
the cruelty will play a role in the coming faith


Setting alight from overhead: \
Abandon me as your ancestor
