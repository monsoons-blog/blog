Confusing myself for the bad deed   
I woke up at sunrise and said: not anymore <br>
Like escaping your own smell <br>
And I would molt skin and bone but my ancestor said: <br>
the scent lingers 

Incarcerated firefighters today announced a breakthrough  <br>
I was heartbroken in believing the progress

Retaliations confused us, we thought we had <br>
quenched it safely in the near east (the far west) <br>
until the jungles melted to a virus of trash bags <br>
masked in tropical fragrance

Perhaps it is not up to me so Iâ€™ll say <br>
I light this flame in dedication to my progenitors, <br>
part of the human inheritance

In the name of posterity: <br>
I drone strike our archeaology into a boneless soil <br>
this underbrush has been building up long between us <br>
down in the crowded underworld

you disbelieve when I say violence is chronic to every evolution <br>
you stand for sapient exceptionalisms reminiscent of America

In truth I pray you will condemn me, forgive me for napalm baptismals <br>
the cruelty will play a role in the coming faith


Setting alight from overhead: <br>
Abandon me as your ancestor
