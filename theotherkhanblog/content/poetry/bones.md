Cook with the meat on the bone \
I rip through myself looking for bones \
Authenticity, I only seek things I don't believe in, God \
Here are the maps my uncles prepared   
The scrolls soak in tea until the borders disappear into milk \
I tell other people who they are not so that I can name myself  
It's what I've always wanted â€” a new name \
Same skin, new bones, white milk, home \
My uncle asks if I pray for here or home \
I stay silent, suspended in disbelief
