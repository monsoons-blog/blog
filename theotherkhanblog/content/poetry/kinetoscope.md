Late to play, I rush to him \
Allahu la ilaha – the rhythmic murmur begins \
he blows hurriedly on his restive child \
Climbing trees, eating muddy leaves – I frisk, I fall \
Back at home, \
solace lingers unbound

A wrinkled, disquiet hand \
my grip gently placating his \
A hospital bed basking in sunlight \
Dada’s intent gaze – reading mine \
Asked me not to stay, \
said no goodbyes

In the garage of my ancestral home, \
laid a loved one’s coffin \
A moment of unassailable grief \
slightly eased \
Untouched by words – \
my palm, gently squeezed

Jolted out of deep slumber, clenching the sheet \
my unbridled outpour, \
his unflinching peace \
Indifference abrim in eyes \
what once was love \
Now misery in disguise

Rooftops, lakeside, stories on loop \
playful silence resting \
in crevices of words \
unwittingly memorized \
Compass unscathed; I made \
a friend for life

An unveiled embrace \
amid accusing stares \
In the distance, flying machines 
humming away \
years of conditioning up in the air \
– a white flag unabashedly waves

Sitting on the bench – a boy in love \
awash with conundrum, \
his vulnerability \
unwillingly tethered \
reluctance giving way, my fingers touch his face – \
he crumbles.
