_aisa bhi koi khuda kya — ke chalte kaam jaayenge rook?_ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Poor Rich Boy, “Tootay Huay Admi”

*I.* \
i have forty fasts neglected, marked \
into my skin like tallies for when it is \
time for condensation. now waiting. \
now the singed scent of deposition. now \
silence. now i am studying my ancestors, \
my experiments. now let me assess.

*II.* \
my Lord do not let this spring bloom. \
do not let the vine climb any higher \
or i will confuse its shadow for an \
eclipse. i will puncture a leaf, \
ceaseless searching for sclerosis. \
my Lord why don’t You grieve? 

*III.* \
there is so much noise in \
my asylum & now this temple \
this shelter is obsolete a building \
of stone with so many etchings the \
walls are thinner than the parchment upon \
which i will continue to write my futile letters

*IV.* \
now watch. i am basking in the remains \
of your retired machinery & every insult \
is an inverted acknowledgement of Who \
i believe exists sometimes but still, it is so easy \
to dissolve it is so hard to be dissolved—ego \
mangled, membranes still steadfast now—
