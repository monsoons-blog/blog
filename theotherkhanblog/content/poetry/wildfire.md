I was a believer and it's wildfire season

Prove yourself to your homelands but dont move back \
My corporation goes to trial and settles: intermittent recycling programs \
My algorithm suggests buying crescent moon jewelry \
Dear all: but all too late. Flooding fires, fiery floods, the flight \
I unoriginate away in the ozone \
tearing privilege of heritage jetting 

Responsibility shoved into words: this poem \
The confusion of profit, of prophets \
Iconoclasm: surgical strike of the starbucks straws \
Common bloodletting amongst the dunes (Allahuakbar)

Prayers and just that; I look away into poetry
