Jostling against tiny shoulders \
You make your way through \
A moment’s pause at the threshold – \
No time to spare \
A hurried entrance \
A foregone goodbye \
What is this place? \
First glance – \
Eyes met with grandeur \
An apparent immaculacy \
Ceilings high \
Walls paneled \
A grand chandelier \
Over a marble floor \
A helical staircase \
Carved handrails \
Going up \
Going down \
Take your pick \
There’s some noise downstairs \
A jamboree of sorts \
You walk towards it \
And look up \
The light falling through the skylight \
Equally enticing \
Time is running fast \
How do you choose? \
Wait \
See this floor first \
Strange, so empty \
Walking through it quietly \
You see it clearer \
Grandness – a wobble \
Barely standing \
Walls – just boards \
Encasing the stone \
Paint peeling off \
To reveal some more \
You zoom in \
It’s not so bad \
Behold the layers \
A futile attempt \
To mask the old, \
The memorable \
The insecure. \
You try scraping it off \
It only allows so much \
Residue stuck in the nails – \
A reminder \
Of what cannot be forced \
You walk through the hallway \
Wondering still \
A faint uneasiness \
A constant tugging \
No time to spare \
So much to see \
This empty grandiose \
And the other unseens

It’s tough outside \
You just got lucky.
