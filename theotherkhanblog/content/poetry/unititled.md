Two brothers walked in the alleyway \
the way I wish I could with you 

My uncle asked: do you pray for America or Pakistan? \
I said both, ashamed of my disbelief 

Here faith is rain and I seek truth in the nuqta \
In our chowk the smog chokes like time did when I put garlands in her hair or \
the moment before a drone converts a village to an archaeology 

Let me tell you a secret: the winter smog is riverwater  
evaporating from the void of a zero point border \
A conspiracy of the line against the nuqta \
Today the mob was overheard saying: should the white rectangle be cut? \
And you cried for the voiceless in a way that finds me years later \
suspended out over an Atlantic ozone 

I dont know where you really are \
I only visit briefly, a thief giving alms \
See the well was dug and they hit ink instead of water \
but I looked closer and it was blood

I climbed deeper and there were checkpoints \
architected into childhood, in the absence of  baba or \
before the time of Buddha 

Years have been spent curating this archaeology \
crumbling before a gaze that deems them counterfeit  

This is your captain speaking: Its 42 degrees centigrade outside \
and welcome back to the sunrise \
Our encounters are a palimpsest and \
I begin to unpack language from the suitcase
