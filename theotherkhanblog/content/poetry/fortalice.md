And: 

While the beggar croons falsetto, \
While the cartoonist scribbles dust,

While the merchant skins coconut, \
While the separatist bottles wine,

While the palmist spills ink, \
While the taverner potions pills,

While the dancer shoots balloons, \
While the sweeper crosses borders,

The gangster awaits with deviled bangles for his muse \
In a house charmed by the ghosts of Syeds.

Three Sikh kings compete, converge, fail \
In a triangular neighorhood crowned by a fortalice.

An unsharp spear hangs on the jaundiced wall \
In a religious school sawed in half by a clericâ€™s ego.

Today I walked to the shrine of the jasmine women \
In a street made sinuous, inked by blood.
