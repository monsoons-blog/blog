Hi! I'm a Master's CS student at NYU Courant, and formerly a Data Scientist at the Logistics Management Institute in Washington DC. I have 2+ years of experience with applied machine learning and software development for federal clients. My research interests include generative language modeling and NLP on low resource languages.  

On the side, I am an organizer at Alif Se Yeh, an Urdu poetry and literature learning platform.
